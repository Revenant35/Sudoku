# Sudoku

The goal of this project is to create a Sudoku AI which will solve a given board with back tracking. I will be creating this in JavaFX with Gradle so that I can visually show the progress of the board, the steps the AI takes, and the initial input. I want to show a simple algorithm in a nice, visually appealing way.
